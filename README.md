# AWS Lambda Function - Web Scraping and File Processing

This is an AWS Lambda function written in Python that performs web scraping and file processing tasks. It is designed to be triggered by an event, such as the creation of an object in an S3 bucket.

## Functionality

1. The function receives an event and context as parameters.
2. It retrieves the object from the event and identifies its content type.
3. The function connects to AWS S3 and specifies the source and destination buckets.
4. It attempts to retrieve the specified object from the source bucket.
5. The function puts the retrieved object into the destination bucket as a file named `results.csv`.
6. The `read` function reads the content of a CSV file.
7. The `write` function is responsible for writing the results to a file.
